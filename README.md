# Random-small-apps
This repository contains a bunch of (very) small apps. These apps are here just to be here, and therefore can contain bad code.
# The apps:
**Continue or exit**\
This app is an app that allows you to continue to increment a variable for no reasons, or exit the app. Type "c" to increment the variable and "e" to exit.\
**Write A**\
Write A is an app that can write a lot of "A"s. When you start the app, just type the numbers of A that you want to write, and then you can let the app write the "A"s for you.\
**EchoMore**\
EchoMore is really just a copy of the echo command but you need to enter what you want to echo after you start the program (it doesn't supports options).
